# FAKE-NEWS-ML-MODEL
This project is a simple web application that uses a deep learning model to detect fake news from given text input.The model is trained using TensorFlow and uses a dataset of news articles to classify input text as either real news or fake news.

The web application is built using Flask and consists of a single page with a form where users can input the text they want to analyze. The result is displayed below the form after the text has been processed by the model.

How to Run:

Install the required dependencies, such as Flask and TensorFlow, using pip.
Run the app.py file to start the Flask application.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to use the web application.

Usage:

Enter the text you want to analyze in the textarea on the web page.
Click the "Detect" button to submit the form.
The result, either "Real news" or "Fake news," will be displayed below the form after the text has been processed by the model.
